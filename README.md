Description: How to locate and transmit information between different points in spacetime.
This project is based on research in astrophysics and Artificial Intelligence with the prospect of implementing a QGAN (Quantum Generative Adversarial Neural Network) initially in classical computation as a translation to qubit logic gates. The research was conducted in the expectation of next generation quantum computers that utilize 4-dimensional qubits to locate and transmit information between mathematical points in space. Such a process is a communication method taking advantage of negative energy (the absence of known matter) which uses hydrogen anions generated by mirroring extra electrons into the destination location. Following this, the model calculates the negative energy density of the target location, deriving the value of negative energy from this information. The value of negative energy determines the exact moment when to produce an output. Part of the method involves quantum tunneling to alter the electrons in the target to match data which is mathematically mirrored from the source who locates data, takes a mirror copy, converts the data into brain scan images and channels them with tunneling into the hydrogen electrons of the target.

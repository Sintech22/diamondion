How to locate and transmit information between different points in spacetime
This project is best described by quoting the lyrics of Bal-Sagoth's 'The Star Maps of Ancient Cosmographers':
"Everything you have been taught about the nature of creation is a lie. This is a voyage in search of the truth. It will not be a pleasant journey. I have discovered a terrifying universal axiom which cannot be denied."
